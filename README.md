This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

In this challenge you'll build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. Along the way, you'll learn about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.

Before starting this challenge, make sure you've read the "Welcome" part of the
book that contains these chapters:

- [Introduction](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html) (chapter 1)
- [A Map of the Territory](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html)
  (chapter 2)
- [The Lox Language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)
  (chapter 3)
